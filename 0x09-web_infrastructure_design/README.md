## Concepts
*           _For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:_      
    
         
    
    *               [DNS](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/12)          
    
    *               [Monitoring](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/13)

    *               [Server](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/67)

### At the end of this project students should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:
*   You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
*   You must be able to explain what are each component doing
*   You must be able to explain system redundancy
*   Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements:

### Project Requirements
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
*   This project will be manually reviewed:
*   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
*   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m_O2HLsKrO1zg31LMcLOGQ "imgur") but feel free to use anything you want). 
*   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file 
*   After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
*   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
*   Focus on what you are being asked: 
*   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
*   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
*   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
*   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
